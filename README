These are the blog posts for http://blog.canstack.ca.

Currently they are licensed under creative commons. The CanStack website is based on a template I purchases so I can't put those files in this repository, thus only the blog posts are here.

The posts are in textile, and the static blog pages are generated by Jekyll. It would be great to get blog post pull requests. :)

Thanks,
Curtis
